CSS Modules
###########

CSS Modules are a way to write CSS that's scoped to a single css file, rather than globally.
It's a way to write modular CSS that won't conflict with other styles in your app, but still has meaningful class names.

More on CSS Modules can be found in their `GitHub <https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules>`_ documentation.

Usage
#####

To use CSS Modules in a component, import the ``CSS`` class from the ``pydom.styling`` module.
Then, use the ``CSS`` to import your css files.

.. code-block:: css

    /* card.css */

    .card {
        background-color: white;
        border: 1px solid black;
        border-radius: 5px;
        padding: 10px;
    }


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Using CSS Modules in a component

    from pydom.styling import CSS

    styles = CSS.module("./card.css")

    class MyComponent(Component):
        def render(self, css):
            return Div(classes=styles.card)(
                "Hello, world!"
            )

This will generate a class name that is unique to this css file, and apply the styles to that class name.
This way, you can be sure that your styles won't conflict with other styles in your app.

When importing the same css file in multiple components, the class name will be the same across all components.

CSS File Lookup
###############

When importing a css file, unless the path starts with a ``./``, PyDOM will look for the css file in 
the root folder for CSS Modules.
By default, the root folder for CSS Modules is the current working directory.
You can change the root folder by calling the ``CSS.set_root_folder`` method.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Changing the root folder for CSS Modules

    from pydom.styling import CSS

    CSS.set_root_folder("./styles")

    styles = CSS.module("card.css")
