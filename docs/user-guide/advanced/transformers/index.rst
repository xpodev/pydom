Transformers are a powerful feature of PyDOM that allow you to customize the way elements are rendered.

There are two types of transformers in PyDOM:

- :ref:`property-transformers`: Used to transform the properties of elements.
- :ref:`post-render-transformers`: Used to transform the entire HTML content after it is rendered.
